# Titanic Survivals Prediction
This repository documents my approach to a challenge I encountered during my academic year. The task was to develop a predictive model to answer the question: *"What types of people were more likely to survive?"* in the context of the Titanic disaster.  

  The repository includes the following files:
  - `main.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code and results of the challenge.
  - `Data` folder: Contains the dataset used for the challenge, pre-split into `train.csv` and `test.csv` files.
